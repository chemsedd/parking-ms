# **Parking Management System**

PMS is a web solution for parking management problems.

## **Sections**
PMS is divided into the following sections:

1. **Login Page**: for users/admins to login. It provides 2 input fields (Username & Password). The user also has the possibility to revocer his lost password or username through his email.

   - Available parking lots (Total, Empty, Full).
   - Brief history of today's clients (tickets given, time and where parked).

3. **Sidebar**: displays brief user/admin infos and provides access to other sections of the system.
   1. Username and profile picture.
   2. Status (user, admin)
   3. Disconnect.
